## Sample Social Media Posts

### LinkedIn - Thought Leadership
"Retail shrinkage cost the industry $112 billion last year. But here's what most don't realize: 65% isn't theft—it's administrative error, vendor fraud, and simple miscounts.

Traditional inventory systems require constant manual intervention, leading to mistakes. The future? Computer vision that tracks every product automatically, turning your existing security cameras into intelligent inventory managers.

At InventoryVision AI, we're using Vision Language Models and 3D reconstruction to give retailers real-time, accurate inventory without any manual scanning.

The result? Our customers see 60% reduction in shrinkage and save 20+ hours per week on inventory management.

The question isn't whether AI will transform retail inventory—it's whether you'll be early or late to adopt it.

### Twitter - Quick Tip
"Inventory accuracy tip: If you're doing manual counts once a week, you're essentially blind the other 6 days.

Our AI tracks inventory 24/7 using your existing cameras. See changes the moment they happen, not days later.

### Mastodon - Technical Deep-Dive
"How we built privacy-first inventory tracking:

Our SAM3D segmentation pipeline is trained exclusively on products, not people. We use:
- Instance segmentation focused on retail objects
- Deliberate exclusion of facial recognition
- On-device processing for sensitive data
- Open standards for data portability

Retail surveillance ≠ Inventory intelligence

We believe you can have powerful AI without compromising privacy.
