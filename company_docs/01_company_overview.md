# InventoryVision AI - Company Overview

## Mission Statement
Transform retail inventory management through advanced computer vision, making real-time, accurate stock tracking accessible to businesses of all sizes.

## Company Description
InventoryVision AI is a cutting-edge technology company that revolutionizes retail inventory tracking by leveraging existing security camera infrastructure. Our proprietary system combines Vision Language Models (VLMs) with advanced 3D image segmentation pipelines (SAM3D) to automatically create and maintain a comprehensive 3D digital inventory of physical store stock.

## The Problem We Solve
Traditional inventory management is:
- **Labor-intensive**: Requires manual counting and tracking
- **Error-prone**: Human error leads to stock discrepancies
- **Costly**: Shrinkage, theft, and misplaced items cost retailers billions annually
- **Time-consuming**: Physical audits take employees away from customer service
- **Reactive**: Issues are discovered only after they occur

## Our Solution
InventoryVision AI turns passive security cameras into active inventory management systems:
- **Zero Additional Hardware**: Works with existing security camera infrastructure
- **Automated Tracking**: Continuous, real-time inventory updates without manual intervention
- **3D Digital Library**: Creates detailed 3D models of every item in your store
- **Daily Reconciliation**: Automatically detects what's been added, sold, or moved
- **Predictive Analytics**: Identifies patterns in stock movement and potential issues

## Target Market
- **Primary**: Small to medium-sized retail stores (500-10,000 sq ft)
- **Secondary**: Large retail chains seeking to modernize inventory systems
- **Tertiary**: Warehouses, distribution centers, and stockrooms

## Competitive Advantages
1. **No New Infrastructure Required**: Leverages existing cameras
2. **3D Spatial Understanding**: Unlike traditional 2D systems, we create full 3D representations
3. **AI-Powered Intelligence**: VLMs understand context, not just object detection
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-based processing with edge computing options
5. **Plug-and-Play Integration**: Works with major POS and inventory management systems

## Company Values
- **Innovation**: Pushing the boundaries of computer vision technology
- **Accessibility**: Making enterprise-grade technology available to all retailers
- **Transparency**: Clear pricing, clear results, clear benefits
- **Privacy-First**: Inventory-focused, not surveillance-focused
- **Sustainability**: Reducing waste through better inventory management
